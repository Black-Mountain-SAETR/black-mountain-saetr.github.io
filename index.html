    <h3>Info:</h3>
    <p>
    Black Mountain Sharpening and Edged Tool Repair is catered towards anyone who needs kitchen cutlery of all sorts, axe heads, bayonets, everyday pocket knives, almost anything that cuts. Shoot me a message on Messenger and we will discuss the options and pricing. (if someone brings me a butter knife I'll do it, gotta get though that butter somehow)<br><br>
    PRICES:
    Standard sharpening*: $4 per inch
    Sharpening + blade polish*: $5 per inch
    The works***: $5.50 per inch
    All blade and handle repairs need to be evaluated and discussed to determine price
    *Standard sharpening includes coarse, medium, and fine grit stone sharpening and a light buff with 3000 grit sandpaper
    ** Sharpening + blade polish include the standard sharpening, and I will start with a 1500 grit sandpaper and work my way up to 3000, then finish it off with a white diamond polish for a near-new look
    *** The works includes removal of rust/patina, rounding off of any sharp edges near the handle that cause any discomfort while in use,  a polish starting at 600 grit and working up to 3000, and white diamond blade polish. 
    Please specify the type of steel since carbon steel has to be cared for a bit different than stainless steel, if you don't know it's no biggie, usually I can tell while sharpening.
    ALL KNIVES ARE WASHED AND DRIED AFTER I WORK ON THEM.
